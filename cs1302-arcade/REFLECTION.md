Here is a sample entry (delete this line; also: feel free to copy/paste/modify):

## Deadline 1 - TUE 2020-12-01 (Dec 01)

1. I have have not changed the starter code yet.
2. I plan to have a significant amount of the basic logic for Reversi completed.
3. I plan on branching out to work on the "capturing" feature in Reversi

## Deadline 2 - TUE 2020-12-08 (Dec 08)
1. I created the game board and I also worked on the game pieces for Reversi. I also added
   a mouse handler for each square on the game board so that a piece is added to the boared when it is clicked.
   I did this on a separate branch called "gamePieces" which I did not merge with master yet. I also had a conflict
   where my default branch was called main and I had no master branch. I created a master branch, merged it with main,
   and deleted the main branch after changing the default branch to master. I did this after I submitted for deadline 1.
   So my branch in deadline 1 was called main instead of master. I was not able to work on the main logic for the game yet
   even though that was my plan which I mentioned in deadline 1.
2. I plan to complete the main logic for the game before the deadline.
3. I did not understand how to upload pictures to Odin so that I can locally implement them in my project. I also need to see
   how to get the coordinates of a square on the board when the square is clicked. This is very important when I code the main
   game logic.

## Deadline 3 - WED 2020-12-16 (Dec 16)
1. I finished the main game logic for Reversi as planned in deadline 2 and also udded images and updated the ATTRIBUTION.md file.
2. I figured tried using the git website to upload pictures onto odin. I realized that I could upload pictures to my remote repository
    on git and then pull those changes from the virtual machine on odin.
3. No extra credit done.
